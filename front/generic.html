						<p>Using Rock Paper Scissors to play a chess game.</p>

					<p>Barca is a two-player strategy board game invented by Andrew Caldwell.[1] It is played on a 10x10 checkered board with three types of animal playing-pieces that move like the queen, bishop and rook in chess. Two distinguishing features from a typical chess variant are the absence of capture, and the fundamental role of a rock-paper-scissors dominance relationship among the three types of pieces: elephant, lion and mouse.</p>

					<p>Each player controls six animals comprising two of each animal type. The object of the game is to occupy three of the four “watering hole” squares that are located near the center of the board.</p>

					<p>A player’s animals are friendly to each other, meaning they are allowed to occupy squares adjacent to each other. For opposing sides, however, the mouse fears the lion, the lion fears the elephant, and the elephant fears the mouse; an animal cannot move to a square, nor permanently abide in a square, that is adjacent to an animal it fears (with the exception of a "trapped" animal, as described in Movement Restrictions below).</p>

					<p>Achieving the win-condition requires coordinating one’s animals in support of each other to hold two of the watering holes, against the opponent’s attempts to repel, while creating an opening to occupy a third watering hole.</p>
